# UsefulCode
Useful code for useful people!

UsefulCode is a repository for R code examples (i.e., snippets) to support your data analysis projects. Each example addresses a specific problem, making it easy to find the solution you need. If you have useful code to share, feel free to suggest an example through a Pull Request.

Currently, R code examples don't need to be formatted as 'reprex' (reproducible examples). Below, you'll find a description of each script and its intended purpose.
